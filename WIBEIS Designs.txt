Collections:
	-All image processes up until, and including, detection.
	-Collections do not get deleted, instead they are archived, and allowed to be brought up at later times.  This allows for re-running detection at future times, on animals in the image that were not previously detected.

Workplace:
	-Filtering options determine whether or not images are shown, and determine which annotations are shown.  If the filtering options are, for example, only "Time" or "Location," images are allowed to be shown in this workplace.  However, if there are more filter restrictions, such as "species," that the base images do not contain, then images are not shown. This creates an easy way to restrict a workspace to only annotations, a.k.a., only images that have had detection run on them and had an animal found.
	-Workplaces can be created and changed dynamically.
	-If you click an annotation, a modal shows up with details about that image, including a link/image of the image it was derived from. This allows linking of an annotation to it's parent image, without showing the parent image in the workplace, reducing clutter/unnecessary images.
	-When you view a workplace, the sidebar displays all in-process collections that, so far, fit the criteria for that workplace. E.g., if a workplace is for Grevy Zebras in Leua, Then all in-process collections taken in Leua will be displayed on the sidebar.  This allows easy access to unprocessed images that may fit into a workplace, while still keeping them separate from the images that are "definitely" meant to be in the workplace.


Should collections be flat, dag, or file-structure-like? I vote file-structure, based on upload, for simplicity and intuitiveness.
