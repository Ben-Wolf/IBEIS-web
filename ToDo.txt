Image Viewer:
	Important: Find out how image data will be given to us, and how to properly pass that data into photoswipe
	-Create a grid system for photoswipe images, with openphotoswipe(index) as the onclicks

    questions:
        -what data do we have associated with the actual image?
        -Can we easily get the dimensions of the image (photoswipe requires this- if not, we can use a different, similar viewer.  Photoswipe is best option though)
